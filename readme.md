# DissidentGo

This code is a port of Bram Cohens Steganographic Library/Protocol DissidentX. What it allows you to do, is to embed a hidden, encrypted message in nearly any text, source code, essays, news articles, etc. It works by identifying an aspect of the input text and using alternatives to it as the method of storing data. One simple example is tabs vs spaces, each instance of a tab or set of spaces is one 'bit' of storage.
